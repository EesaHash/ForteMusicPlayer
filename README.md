# Forte Musical Instrument Player
Forte is a simple DAW (music notation software) implemented using the processing library as a GUI. Users can play different notes such as piano, mamba etc. Playback can be stopped, paused and different "tracks" can be saved to an external file.

The application can be executed using gradle via the run command ("gradle run") in a terminal.
